                    <h3>Why do we need to block Sessions?</h3>
                    <p>He has a longstanding voting record in opposition to important civil liberties and civil rights legislation.  And beyond that, Sessions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>said the KKK was “okay, until [he] found out they smoked pot”</li>
                        <li>has suggested freedom of religion might not apply to immigrants, and it might be time to consider Trump’s call for a ban on Muslims</li>
                        <li>is so anti-immigrant he has even challenged birthright citizenship</li>
                        <li>has called the NAACP and the ACLU “un-American”</li>
                        <li>once called a white civil rights attorney a “disgrace to his race,” and repeatedly called a Black lawyer “boy"</li>
                        <li>characterized the Voting Rights Act as "a piece of intrusive legislation” and has refused to support legislation to restore it after it was gutted by the Supreme Court</li>
                        <li>stood up for the banking industry when the banks were melting down in 2008</li>
                        <li>pressured Attorney General Janet Reno not to pursue anti-trust charges against Microsoft in the 1990s</li>
                        <li>and defended Donald Trump’s recorded bragging about grabbing women by their genitals by saying, “I don't characterize that as sexual assault."</li>
                    </ul>

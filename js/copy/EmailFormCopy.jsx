            <br/>
            <p>"We urge Congress to significantly improve the so-called “USA Liberty Act,” H.R. 3989, or support strong surveillance reform legislation if wholesale improvements are not forthcoming. As introduced, this bill would extend Section 702, enabling the Trump administration to continue spying on Americans without a warrant.</p>
            <br />
            <p><span>"The strong language we support is contained in the USA RIGHTS Act, sponsored by Sens. Paul and Wyden, which ends backdoor searches, permanently bans “about” collection, and guarantees that surveillance information cannot be secretly used in court against defendants. Without these reforms to protect our privacy and civil liberties, Section 702 must expire."</span></p>

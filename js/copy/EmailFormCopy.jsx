            <p>"We urge Congress to significantly improve the so-called “USA Liberty Act,” H.R. 3989, or support strong surveillance reform legislation if wholesale
                improvements are not forthcoming. As introduced, this bill would extend Section 702, enabling the Trump administration to continue spying on Americans without a warrant.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><span>Any reauthorization of Section 702 must end backdoor searches, permanently ban “about” collection, and guarantee that surveillance information cannot be secretly used in court against defendants. Unfortunately, the USA Liberty Act lacks all of these provisions. Without these reforms, Section 702 must expire."</span></p>

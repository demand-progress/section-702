//         <h3>Trump’s Broken Promises</h3>
//         Trump promised on election night to be “a president for all Americans.” But the parade of horribles that Trump has nominated to his administration show he is welcoming hate right into the White House.
//         <div className="spacer" />
//         And his pledge during the campaign to “drain the swamp” and make Washington work for ordinary Americans instead of powerful elites? Forget about it. Trump’s cabinet is so pro-corporate it’s called “an investment banker’s dream.”
//         <div className="spacer" />

//         <h3>Who the Trump Cabinet Really Works For</h3>
//         Wall Street bankers and Trump’s corporate cronies are cheering the Trump agenda. It’s a corporate wish list that would eliminate protections for working people and our environment, and eviscerate strong rules reining in Wall Street.
//         <div className="spacer" />

If confirmed, he would be responsible for enforcing the country’s civil rights laws, despite <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/jeff-sessions-racism-allegations/index.html" target="_blank">a history</a> of calling a black subordinate "boy," "joking" about supporting the Ku Klux Klan, and calling the ACLU and NAACP "un-American."

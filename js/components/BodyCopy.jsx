        <h3>Trump's Broken Promises</h3>
        <p>Trump promised on election night to be “a president for all Americans.” But the parade of horribles
            that Trump has nominated to his administration show he is welcoming hate right into the White
            House.</p>
        <div className="spacer"></div>
        <p>And his pledge during the campaign to “drain the swamp” and make Washington work for ordinary
            Americans instead of powerful elites? Forget about it. Trump’s cabinet is so pro-corporate it’s
            called “an investment banker’s dream.”</p>
        <div className="spacer"></div>
        <h3>Who the Trump Cabinet Really Works For</h3>
        Wall Street bankers and Trump’s corporate cronies are cheering the Trump agenda. It’s a corporate wish
        list that would eliminate protections for working people and our environment, and eviscerate strong
        rules reining in Wall Street.
        <div className="spacer"></div>
        <p>The Trump administration is shaping up to benefit Donald Trump and his family’s business empire in a
            big way, with massive conflicts of interest posed by Trump’s continued stake in the Trump
            Organization.</p>
        <div className="spacer"></div>
        <h3>The Senate Must Block and Resist Trump's Cabinet</h3>
        <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmation power over most of Trump's cabinet. Senators must use this power to
            block and resist Trump’s cabinet of hate and greed. Consider who we’re talking about:</p>

        <p>The Senate will be narrowly divided 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats in 2017 and many key
            Senate committees will be split 10-9 or 11-10. <strong>If Democrats stick together it could only
                take one or two principled Republican votes to block many of Trump’s nominees.</strong></p>

        <p>Donald Trump may have won the Electoral College, but members of the U.S. Senate should not give any
            support to Trump appointees espousing racism, xenophobia, misogyny, homophobia, climate denial, and
            corporate greed.</p>
